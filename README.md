# Bitcoin Bootcamp Store

## Description

As the bootcamp comes to a close, we wanted to create a project dedicated to our journey, our classmates and our *fearless* leader, Sal Hobbi. Throughout the course, we enjoyed an ongoing joke about betting bitcoins when contributing an answer to class questions. There was also chocolate rewarded as the result of correctly answered questions — which Sal would generously eat on our behalf. Adding to the prevailing chocolate theme, one of the earliest example websites during our pre-work was titled “Ode to Chocolate” as well. Through Bootcamp Bitcoin Store, we aim to elevate this concept of bitcoin and chocolates into a real online store where students can reap the rewards of their participation.

Bootcamp Bitcoin Store is an online store where students of Sal Hobbi’s Fullstack Coding Bootcamp are able to spend their participation bitcoins on chocolatey rewards. Each student will have their own password-protected account that stores their bitcoin budget. Students are free to spend their bitcoin by purchasing chocolate products of various prices neatly organized on the homepage. Individual product pages will also contain further information about the selected chocolate item. The purchases will be summarized in a dynamic shopping cart where individual line items can be updated. The store will also include a fun leaderboard feature that indicates the rank of the user’s participation bitcoin wallet. This application will serve as an educational tool for incentivising and rewarding class participation.
